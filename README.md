# ☁️ Weather App CSV Repository

Welcome to our collaborative weather app data repository. This project is designed to share and sync CSV files related to weather analytics. No code or app logic will be maintained here — it's purely for structured data sharing.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/weather-csv-repo.git
   cd weather-csv-repo

 
   - Switch to the develop Branch


git checkout develop



🌿 Working with Branches
To make changes without affecting the shared develop branch directly:
- Create a new branch

git checkout -b 
<your-branch-name>(develop)
git checkout -b develop
- Make changes and add your CSV
- Place new CSV files inside the appropriate folder (e.g., /data/).
- Stage your changes:
git add .
- Commit your updates
git commit -m "Add: updated weather data for July"
- Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin <your-branch-name>
(develop)


🔄 Pulling & Syncing Updates
To sync your local branch with the latest updates from the shared repo:
- Switch to develop
git checkout develop
- Pull the latest changes
git pull origin develop
- (Optional) Merge updates into your branch
git checkout 
(develop)<your-branch-name>
git merge develop



📦 Folder Structure
weather-csv-repo/
├── data/            # CSV files go here
├── README.md        # This guide



🧠 Notes
- Keep branch names descriptive: shanna-july-data, team1-forecast-cleanup, etc.
- Try to always pull from develop before pushing new changes.
- Avoid pushing large binary files — we’re keeping it lightweight.

Happy CSV sharing! 🌦
